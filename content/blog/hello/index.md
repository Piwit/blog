Welcome to my blog, we are the first of April 2020 and now seems the perfect time to start something new.

##Â Who am I?

Let's start with some presentation then! I'm Lucas, a young software developer.
I graduated last year and started working as a freelance in Corsica. It's not the richest ecosystem but hey, we have a cool __top-level domain name__ ðŸ˜Ž. I, therefore, mostly work remotely from home.

As of now, my skills turn around web development, mostly with the Django framework and progressively with React.js.
I'm versatile and likes to tinker with pretty much everything related to a web app, from docker to UX design, passing by some server configuration.
I recently had the opportunity to setup the Zoho One Suite for a local company, discovering new ways to help people with fewer lines of code.


## What you can expect here...


Here I will write some technical articles, tutorials and give my modest opinion on technical stuff. I will use this blog to present some side projects. I'm currently intrigued by [TerminusDB](https://terminusdb.com/), a graph database. I also want to build some skills for a google assistant to make some boring stuff easier.
Later I would like to present to you a network architecture made with mesh wifi routers and maybe some other stuff made with microcontrollers.

However don't expect regular articles, for now, I will try to publish at least one monthly article.
I consider this blog as a big toy and want to have fun with it. It's built with the standard gatsby blog template and hosted on netlify.
I will tweak it sooner or later, first to add a commenting system, then to make it feel less generic. [Feel free to check the repository on github.](https://github.com/Piwit/blog)


Let's hope you and I will have fun!
(and that a second article will be written ^^)
